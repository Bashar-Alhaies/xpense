# Xpense

### Disclaimer: The design for this website was taken from [Mohammad Ali](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1017796439842049665). I converted it to a website with React.

## Description

Xpense is a budget tracker and analyzer. This project was built using React as a UI library and Chakra UI as a css framework. I find that using Chakra UI is helpful for small and fast prototyping projects. However, if you would like to build things for the long run then using tailwind css is much better in this situation. Another, thing I noticed is the documentation ins Chakra UI is lacking sometimes and I learnt from looking at code examples more than the documentation since sometimes it was not mentioned.
